## our business extension for Google managed Chrome stations in support of our EHR systems

This extension is made for our business needs using Google managed Chrome workstations.  By adding a configuration file into the respective Directory OU, this extension will enforce these app policies to allow for compatibility with some older patient portal sites, assigning a custom URL for Chrome's new tab page, custom buttons in the options page, and a Print action button in our EHR electronic medical record suite - webOMR.
